<p id="verse1">Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long<br>
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?<br>
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,<br>
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?<br></p>

<p id="verse2">Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem<br>
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;<br>
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,<br>
EAnd gives thy pen both skill and argument.</p>

<p id="verse3">Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey<br>
If time have any wrinkle graven there;<br>
If any, be a satire to decay,<br>
And make time's spoils despis√®d everywhere.</p>

<p id="verse4">Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;<br>
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.</p>
