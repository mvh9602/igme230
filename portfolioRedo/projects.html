            <p>2017. Astral Outbreak was a group project for GDAPS 2 during my first year at RIT. Within the group I
                was team lead. My responsibility was schedule meetings, manage documents, ensure progress, and help
                program. I mainly worked on enemy AI and helped the architect work on non UI programming. Created in
                monogame. In Astral Outbreak, you play as a stranded space citizen exploring a destroyed space ship in
                an attempt at survival. It is a short 2D shooter with ability upgrades and unique bosses.

            <img src="images/img_nature_wide.jpg" alt="AA Screenshot">
            <p>2015. Aquatic Adventure was group project for an extracuricular technology group in my high school,
                called InterAlliance. In the group, I helped others work with programming in the jmonkey engine. I also
                worked on the AI for sharks. This was the first time working on a game for all of us. Aquatic Adventure
                is an educational game about the lifecycle of a clown fish. You play as the fish from birth to death,
                growing and avoiding sharks as well as starvation. This game won 4th place at the 2015 Tech-Olympics in
                Cincinnati.
