            <p>For the first 18 years of my life, I lived in Loveland Ohio, a small town outside Cincinnati. During
                most of my time at Loveland High School, I was sure I would be a game designer, so I spent a lot of
                time preparing for college. I currently attend the Rochester Institute of Technology for the Game
                Design and Development program. I plan on minoring in music technology. I've been playing numerous
                instruments for about 11 years now, but I've recently been interested in production and composition. I
                hope eventually work in some form of sound work for games. I've worked in a software office before and
                I'm starting to miss it. I'm excited to continue to work towards my degree and can't wait to start my
                CO-OPs.</p>
