            <h1>Project Timeline</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Created HTML framework for content</li>
                <li>Looked into what technology I needed</li>
                <li>Decided not to use any major css framework</li>
                <li>Modified code from w3schools on image galleries to make them much prettier and more intuitive</li>
                <li>Adopted w3.css for certain tools, like w3-center and w3-badge</li>
                <li>Ran into numerous JS issues without after a lot of advice</li>
                <li>Reverted to fairly basic image gallery</li>
                <li>Implimented a sidebar hamburger menu from w3, changed css and added a toggle</li>
                <li>Adapted HTML to use flexbox for positioning and responsive design</li>
                <li>Worked on CSS for index, struggled with fine-tuned positioning</li>
                <li>Added link icons for index page</li>
                <li>Made CSS for remaining pages</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Struggles</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Working with setInterval didn't go well, never worked and often broke other things with it</li>
                <li>Combining aspects of image galleries was difficult as the code examples didn't tend to get along
                    with eachother</li>
                <li>As is apparent every single time I try to work with CSS, I don't know positioning. Still feel
                    fairly clueless there</li>
                <li>Getting the right images was difficult as I didn't have immediate access to most of them</li>
                <li>Converting my resume to html</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Above and Beyond</h1>
            <p>For this requirement, I added some JS functions as mentioned previously for an image gallery and a
                sidebar nav menu. I also wanted my CSS to be easy to read, most so I can look back at it in the future.</p>
            <h1>Tools Used</h1>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">w3.css</a> and various w3 lessons, mainly on their CSS framework</li>
            <li><a href="http://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/">Flexy Boxes</a>, a tool for help creating and toying around with flexbox pages</li>
            <li>Font Awesome Icons</li>
            <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto">Google Fonts: Roboto</a></li>
